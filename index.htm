    <h1>Github Tutorial</h1>
    <p>
      Git is a vital part of many development workflows, including Game Development, Software Development, and even User Interface Design. What actually is Git used for, though? 
      <br><br>
      Git is a type of version control, a way of tracking project history and changes. This allows users to see exactly what was added, removed, or edited in a project. Additionally, because Git tracks all changes, you can see the entire version history of a project. This means that if something breaks along the way, you can reverse the project to a prior version without losing progress.

    <h2>
      Setting up the Environment     
    </h2>
    <p>
      In order to use the full functionality of Github you must first install and setup Git. 
    </p>
    <h3>
      Installing Git
    </h3>
    <p>
      While you may opt to use a GUI based version of git (such as GitHub Desktop or Sourcetree) we will focus on the traditional install methodology.       
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Navigate to Git and <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">download</a> the desktop version. </li>
      <li>Run the installer following all on-screen prompts</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Setting up Git via Visual Studio Code</h3>
    <p>
      To setup Git using traditional methods would involve using the console or power-shell, we can instead utilize Visual Studio code. 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open Visual Studio Code.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the top of your screen, click the terminal tab.
      </li>
      <li>Click new terminal (CTRL+SHIFT+`)</li>
      <li>Configure your git username and email by using these two commands: 
        <br>"$ git config --global user.name "John Doe" 
        <br>"$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com"</li>
      <li>Optionally you can also configure your editor as noted by the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup">documentation.</a></li>

    </ol>
