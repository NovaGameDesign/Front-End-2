  Git is a vital part of many development workflows, including Game Development, Software Development, and even User Interface Design. What actually is Git used for, though? 
  <br><br>
  Git is a type of version control, a way of tracking project history and changes. This allows users to see exactly what was added, removed, or edited in a project. Additionally, because Git tracks all changes, you can see the entire version history of a project. This means that if something breaks along the way, you can reverse the project to a prior version without losing progress.
